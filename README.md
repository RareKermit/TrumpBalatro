# TrumpBalatro
Making Balatro Great Again by uhh, making everything cost more and weakening everything in the game or whatever lol.

I did have some fun with it, but like, I didn't think about it TOO hard you know?  Kind of like Trump with the real tariffs!

Requires steamoded, credit to them for their mod in general, and the ModdedVanilla joker-adding stuff used here as well!
